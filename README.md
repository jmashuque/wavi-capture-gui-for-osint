## Overview

`yt-dlp GUI for OSINT` is a portable Windows interface for running a consistent local capture workflow with `yt-dlp` and a companion PowerShell script.

The app is intentionally narrow in scope. It helps prepare URL lists, run captures, queue work, preview playlists, and review case output. It does not install tools, make authorization decisions, bypass security controls, or analyze evidence.

The current workflow uses four tabs:

- **Capture**: capture setup, URL/input handling, options, preflight, and direct capture
- **Job Queue**: staged jobs, checked-job starts, persistence, interruption recovery, and queue progress
- **Playlist Preview**: playlist source checks, playlist item review, preview pacing, and playlist-derived queue jobs
- **Case Browser**: local case review, file filtering/sorting, thumbnails/media details, and SHA256 verification

## Intended Users

This app is intended for investigators, analysts, or support staff who need a repeatable way to collect media or metadata with `yt-dlp` without rebuilding command-line arguments for every case.

It is designed for internal use in managed environments where binaries, scripts, proxy/VPN use, cookies, storage paths, and capture authority are reviewed separately through normal organizational processes.

## What the App Does

The app helps run a repeatable local capture workflow around approved tools.

Key capabilities include:

- preparing pasted URLs or one or more Input Files
- running preflight checks for local tools and paths
- capturing media, metadata, sidecar artifacts, or embedded metadata
- applying playlist, archive, pacing, retry, format, keyword, and failure-handling options
- staging and running queue jobs
- previewing playlists before capture
- applying domain-based capture presets
- passing optional proxy settings to `yt-dlp`
- organizing output into case folders
- creating URL records and file manifests
- browsing and verifying captured case files

## What the App Does Not Do

The app is not a downloader bundle, browser automation system, security bypass, or evidence analysis platform.

Important limits:

- it does not include or install `yt-dlp`, FFmpeg/FFprobe, Deno, Python, or PowerShell
- it does not bypass EDR/AV, ASR, firewall, proxy, allow-listing, website restrictions, login requirements, paywalls, or rate limits
- it does not decide whether a capture is legal, policy-approved, proportionate, or in scope
- it does not collect passwords, automate sign-ins, solve challenges, or operate a browser for the user
- it does not guarantee support for any source platform
- it does not make proxy/VPN traffic anonymous or invisible to endpoint, network, or administrative controls
- it does not identify people, assess authenticity, classify evidence, summarize media, or determine evidentiary value
- it does not upload, sync, retain, or archive cases to external services

## Organizational Compatibility

This app is designed for managed Windows environments.

Recommended assumptions:

- keep the app folder and Output Root in local non-synced storage
- stage approved builds of `yt-dlp`, FFmpeg/FFprobe, Deno, and Python separately
- expect endpoint protection to inspect or block newly introduced binaries until approved
- keep case folders local during capture, then move or archive through approved processes
- treat cookies, proxy settings, URL lists, and case paths as sensitive operational data

## Required Components

The following components must be present or provided separately:

- Python
- PowerShell
- the Python GUI script, `gui.py`
- the PowerShell capture script, `script.ps1`
- `yt-dlp.exe`
- `ffmpeg.exe`
- `ffprobe.exe`
- `deno.exe`

The GUI script and PowerShell script should stay together in the same portable app folder unless the paths are intentionally changed in the GUI.

Place `deno.exe` in the same folder as `yt-dlp.exe`. From source repos/build packages, keep only the binaries required by this app: `yt-dlp.exe`, `deno.exe`, `ffmpeg.exe`, and `ffprobe.exe`.

Windows includes Windows PowerShell, which is sufficient for `script.ps1`; PowerShell 7 is not required.

Recommended source pages:

- Python downloads: <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>
- Microsoft Store - Python: <https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PNRBTZXMB4Z>
- Microsoft Store - Python Install Manager: <https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NQ7512CXL7T>
- yt-dlp releases: <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases>
- yt-dlp nightly builds: <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds/releases>
- Deno releases: <https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases>
- FFmpeg Windows builds by Gyan.dev: <https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/>

Use official releases whenever possible. For FFmpeg, the Gyan.dev **release essentials** build is usually sufficient because it includes `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe`.

## Basic Usage

1. Place the app in a local non-synced folder.
2. Run `gui.py`.
   - If needed, open a terminal in the app folder and run `python gui.py` or `py gui.py`.
   - To start from a clean app state, run `python gui.py --fresh`.
3. Confirm paths for `script.ps1`, `yt-dlp.exe`, Output Root, and FFmpeg folder.
4. Use the tabs below for capture, queueing, playlist review, and case review.

### Capture Tab

Use this tab to set up and start capture work.

Typical flow:

1. Set the Output Root.
2. Enter a case name or case-name template.
3. Paste URLs or select one or more Input Files.
4. Set capture options only as needed.
5. Run **Preflight Check**.
6. Start the capture directly or add it to the Job Queue.

Notes:

- Cookies File use is disabled by default.
- Check VPN is disabled by default.
- If the URL box is empty, valid Input Files can silently populate it.
- If URL Box Persistence is enabled, saved URL box text loads first on startup.

### Job Queue Tab

Use this tab when captures should be staged, split, resumed, or run in batches.

Typical flow:

1. Add work from the Capture tab or Playlist Preview tab.
2. Check the jobs to run.
3. Start selected jobs or run the full queue.
4. Review status, failures, interruptions, and completed work.

Queued jobs keep their own capture settings. App-level proxy settings are evaluated when the job runs.

### Playlist Preview Tab

Use this tab to inspect playlist-like URLs before capture.

Typical flow:

1. Let the tab load URLs from the current URL box or selected Input Files.
2. Check URL rows and start a preview scan.
3. Review detected playlists and item rows.
4. Queue checked playlists or checked items as needed.

Previewing makes source requests through `yt-dlp` but does not download media.

### Case Browser Tab

Use this tab to review local case output.

Typical flow:

1. Select a case folder or subfolder.
2. Filter or sort files as needed.
3. Open files or related artifacts from file cards.
4. Verify case files against the latest SHA256 manifest when needed.

File-card columns automatically reflow based on the available pane width and selected icon scale.

## Advanced Usage

### Capture Tab: Case Names and URL Sources

Case names can use tags from the **Insert Tag** menu. Tags resolve when a capture starts or when a job is queued.

Useful tags include:

- date/time tags
- URL-domain tags
- preset-related tags
- `%playlist%` for Playlist Preview queue jobs

The default case name is `Case-%datetime%`.

The URL box supports pasted URLs and one or more Input Files. Multiple Input Files are stored as a semicolon-separated list.

URL box helpers can normalize, validate, deduplicate, group, summarize, copy, save, or clear URL text. Failed and captured URL tools use app-level URL history files under the Output Root.

### Capture Tab: Capture, Metadata, Pacing, and Advanced Options

Capture options are split into four panels:

- **Capture Options**: capture mode, source scope, playlist behavior, format, archive behavior, date filters, and Output Records
- **Metadata Options**: sidecar artifacts and embedded metadata
- **Pacing Options**: request delay, retries, throttling behavior, HTTP chunk size, speed limits, and fragment concurrency
- **Advanced Options**: browser impersonation, failure behavior, concurrent queue captures, keyword filters, and partial-file handling

Capture modes:

- **Media + sidecars**: media plus selected sidecar files
- **Media + embedded metadata**: media plus selected embedded metadata, without sidecar artifact files
- **Media only**: media without sidecars or embeds
- **Metadata/artifacts only**: supported artifacts without media download

Output Records controls Case Browser cache timing and file manifest scope.

### Capture Tab: Domain Presets and Proxy Options

Domain Presets save capture-option combinations for one or more domains. Matching active presets can apply automatically, with higher-priority presets overriding lower-priority matches.

Proxy Options are app-level. Supported protocol choices are **None**, `http`, `https`, `socks4`, and `socks5`.

Proxy settings can include credentials. If saved, they are stored unencrypted in `gui-settings.json`. Enable the session-only option when proxy details should not be saved.

### Job Queue Tab: Queue Management

The queue supports:

- checked-job starts
- full-queue starts
- split-and-queue workflows
- interruption recovery
- clearing completed, failed, interrupted, or selected jobs
- persisted queue state in `gui-jobs.json`
- schema warnings for older queued jobs

Concurrent queue capture is available, with domain-collision checks to reduce accidental simultaneous captures against the same domain.

### Playlist Preview Tab: Playlist Review and Queueing

The tab silently parses current URL sources so the list is ready when selected.

The three lists use checkmarks:

- **URLs to Preview** controls which source URLs are queried
- **Playlists Found** controls playlist-level copy and queue actions
- **Playlist Items** controls item-level copy, URL-box, split, queue, and playlist-item-range actions

Preview pacing presets add delay and jitter between preview requests. The app warns before querying more than 10 preview URLs and stops when output suggests rate limiting, bot challenges, or temporary blocking.

Playlist Preview queue actions automatically append `%playlist%` to the queued case template when the template does not already include it.

### Case Browser Tab: Review and Verification

The Case Browser loads the selected Output Root in the background.

It supports:

- folder tree navigation
- current-folder-only view
- file-type filters
- sorting by name, domain, type, size, newest, or oldest
- dynamic file-card columns
- icon scale options
- right-click file actions
- FFmpeg thumbnails in `.gui-cache\thumbnails`
- FFprobe media details in `.gui-cache\metadata`
- SHA256 manifest verification

Verification applies to a selected case folder or subfolder. The Output Root itself cannot be verified. `.gui-cache` and `manifests` are excluded from verification scope.

### App Update Checks

The app update checker opens the latest app release page for manual download. It does not download, extract, replace, or run app files.

yt-dlp updates are separate from normal capture runs and use the selected local `yt-dlp.exe`.

Deno updates can be started from **Tools > Update Deno**, which runs `deno upgrade` against the detected local Deno executable. The app warns first because newer Deno builds may be incompatible or blocked by endpoint controls.

## Profiles and Settings

The app stores settings, profiles, domain presets, and app-level settings in `gui-settings.json` beside the app.

The **Default** profile is loaded on startup. Custom profiles can be created, loaded, saved, and deleted from the Profile menu.

Profile-level settings include capture paths, capture options, metadata options, pacing options, advanced options, URL/input settings, and selected VPN adapter.

App-level settings include Delete Cookies on Exit, Check VPN, Dark Mode, Job Persistence, URL Box Persistence, Case Browser preferences, and Proxy Options.

Other app-root state files:

- `gui-jobs.json` for persisted queue jobs
- `gui-url-box.txt` for URL Box Persistence, when enabled

`python gui.py --fresh` deletes `gui-settings.json`, `gui-jobs.json`, `gui-url-box.txt`, and app-level captured/failed URL history files. It does not delete case folders, media files, cookies, binaries, or scripts.

## Cookies Handling

Cookies File use is disabled by default.

Cookie-related notes:

- cookies are not required for every capture
- cookies are sensitive operational data
- exported cookies can optionally be applied to the main Cookies File field
- local cookie encrypt/decrypt helpers are available
- Delete Cookies on Exit can remove the selected cookies file when the app closes

The app does not automate website logins or collect credentials.

## Limitations

- Site support depends on the installed `yt-dlp` build and the source platform.
- Browser impersonation targets depend on the installed `yt-dlp` build.
- Proxy and VPN behavior depends on local policy and routing.
- Case Browser thumbnails and media details require FFmpeg/FFprobe.
- Very large cases can take time to scan, render, cache, or verify.
- Manifest verification checks file hashes only; it does not assess content authenticity or legal sufficiency.
- The app is not a replacement for authorization, evidence-handling policy, or analyst judgment.

## Changelog

### v0.2026.0616 - Playlist Preview, URL Persistence, and Case Browser Polish

- Added the **Playlist Preview** tab with manual checked/selected preview scans, request pacing, rate-limit/backoff warnings, playlist/item checkmarks, playlist-split queueing, JSON export, and context menus.
- Added `%playlist%` case-name tag support and automatic playlist-title case naming for Playlist Preview queue jobs.
- Added app-level **URL Box Persistence**, silent Input File auto-population when the URL box is empty, and `--fresh` cleanup for persisted URL-box state.
- Changed default app startup behavior so **Check VPN** and **Use Cookies File** are disabled by default.
- Improved the **Case Browser** with better filename wrapping and dynamic file-card columns that reflow with available pane width.
- Refreshed README usage sections around the four main tabs while keeping prior changelog entries intact.

### v0.2026.0614 - Tabs, Presets, Proxy, and Output Records

- Added a bottom-tab workflow for **Capture**, **Job Queue**, and **Case Browser**, with Case Browser loading the selected Output Root in the background and supporting Domain sort.
- Expanded input and queue workflows with multiple Input Files, queue checkmarks, Start Selected, split-and-add-to-queue, persisted jobs, interrupted job handling, and clearer active preset visibility.
- Reworked Domain Presets so presets use names plus one or more match domains, support priority ordering, import conflict choices, and expose matching preset information in the queue.
- Added app-level Proxy Options with protocol/address/port/credential fields, optional session-only storage, script-side proxy validation, and masked proxy logging.
- Added Output Records controls for Case Browser cache timing and file manifest scope; script success now follows yt-dlp results while cache warnings remain non-fatal.
