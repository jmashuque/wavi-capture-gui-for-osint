## Overview

`yt-dlp GUI for OSINT` is a portable Windows interface for running a consistent local capture workflow with `yt-dlp` and a companion PowerShell script.

The app is intentionally narrow in scope. It helps prepare URL lists, run captures, queue work, preview URL metadata and playlist/context entries, optionally cache preview thumbnails, and review case output. It does not bundle tools, automatically install dependencies, make authorization decisions, bypass security controls, or analyze evidence.

The current workflow uses four tabs:

- **Capture**: capture setup, URL/input handling, options, preflight, and direct capture
- **Job Queue**: staged jobs, checked-job starts, persistence, interruption recovery, and queue progress
- **URL Preview**: URL metadata preview, thumbnail preview, playlist/context item review, JSON export, and preview-derived start/queue actions
- **Case Browser**: local case review, file filtering/sorting, thumbnails/media details, and SHA256 verification

## Intended Users

This app is intended for investigators, analysts, or support staff who need a repeatable way to collect media or metadata with `yt-dlp` without rebuilding command-line arguments for every case.

It is designed for internal use in managed environments where binaries, scripts, proxy/VPN use, cookies, storage paths, and capture authority are reviewed separately through normal organizational processes.

## What the App Does

The app helps run a repeatable local capture workflow around approved tools.

Key capabilities include:

- preparing pasted URLs or one or more Input File(s)
- running preflight checks for local tools and paths
- capturing media, metadata, sidecar artifacts, or embedded metadata
- applying playlist, case archive, optional universal archive, pacing, retry, format, keyword, and failure-handling options
- staging and running queue jobs
- previewing URL metadata, thumbnails, and playlist/context entries before capture
- starting, queueing, exporting, or applying filters from URL Preview results
- applying domain-based capture presets
- passing optional proxy settings to `yt-dlp`
- organizing output into case folders
- creating URL records and file manifests
- browsing and verifying captured case files

## What the App Does Not Do

The app is not a downloader bundle, browser automation system, security bypass, or evidence analysis platform.

Important limits:

- it does not bundle `yt-dlp`, FFmpeg/FFprobe, Deno, Python, or PowerShell, and it does not automatically install dependencies; user-triggered update helpers can update existing local yt-dlp or Deno executables
- it does not bypass EDR/AV, ASR, firewall, proxy, allow-listing, website restrictions, login requirements, paywalls, bot challenges, or rate limits
- it does not decide whether a capture is legal, policy-approved, proportionate, or in scope
- it does not collect passwords, automate sign-ins, solve challenges, or operate a browser for the user
- it does not guarantee support for any source platform
- it does not guarantee that URL Preview metadata, titles, thumbnails, uploader names, playlist relationships, or availability fields are complete, current, or authentic
- it does not guarantee thumbnail availability, even when a media URL itself is valid
- it does not make proxy/VPN traffic anonymous or invisible to endpoint, network, or administrative controls
- it does not identify people, assess authenticity, classify evidence, summarize media, or determine evidentiary value
- it does not upload, sync, retain, or archive cases to external services

## Organizational Compatibility

This app is designed for managed Windows environments.

Recommended assumptions:

- keep the app folder and Output Root in local non-synced storage
- stage approved builds of `yt-dlp`, FFmpeg/FFprobe, Deno, and Python separately
- expect endpoint protection to inspect or block newly introduced binaries until approved
- keep case folders local during capture, then move or archive through approved processes
- treat cookies, proxy settings, URL lists, case paths, download archives, URL Preview JSON exports, cached thumbnails, and preview metadata as sensitive operational data

## Required Components

The following components must be present or provided separately:

- Python 3 for the Tkinter GUI
- Windows PowerShell for `script.ps1`
- the Python GUI script, `gui.py`
- the PowerShell capture script, `script.ps1`
- `yt-dlp.exe`
- `ffmpeg.exe`
- `ffprobe.exe`
- `deno.exe`

The GUI script and PowerShell script should stay together in the same portable app folder unless the paths are intentionally changed in the GUI.

Place `deno.exe` in the same folder as `yt-dlp.exe`. From source repos/build packages, keep only the binaries required by this app: `yt-dlp.exe`, `deno.exe`, `ffmpeg.exe`, and `ffprobe.exe`.

Windows includes Windows PowerShell, which is sufficient for `script.ps1`; PowerShell 7 is not required.

Recommended source pages:

- Python downloads: <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>
- Microsoft Store - Python: <https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PNRBTZXMB4Z>
- Microsoft Store - Python Install Manager: <https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NQ7512CXL7T>
- yt-dlp releases: <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases>
- yt-dlp nightly builds: <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds/releases>
- Deno releases: <https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases>
- FFmpeg Windows builds by Gyan.dev: <https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/>

Use official releases whenever possible. For FFmpeg, the Gyan.dev **release essentials** build is usually sufficient because it includes `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe`.

## Basic Usage

### Recommended Workflow for Non-Technical Users

For normal captures, keep the defaults and use this simple flow:

1. Place the app in a local non-synced folder and run `gui.py`.
   - If needed, open a terminal in the app folder and run `python gui.py` or `py gui.py`.
   - To start from a clean app state, run `python gui.py --fresh`; this also clears the temporary Output Root `.gui-cache` folder.
2. Confirm paths for `script.ps1`, `yt-dlp.exe`, Output Root, and FFmpeg folder.
3. Paste URLs into the URL box, then confirm the Case Name and Output Root.
4. Run **Preflight Check**, then click **Start Capture**.
5. Use the Case Browser to review the completed case.

Only change advanced options, cookies, VPN checks, URL Preview settings, or archive settings when the investigation specifically requires them. Use the tabs below for capture, queueing, URL preview, and case review.

### Capture Tab

Use this tab to set up and start capture work.

Typical flow:

1. Set the Output Root.
2. Enter a case name or case-name template.
3. Paste URLs or select one or more Input File(s).
4. Set capture options only as needed.
5. Run **Preflight Check**.
6. Start the capture directly or add it to the Job Queue.

Notes:

- Cookies File use is disabled by default.
- Check VPN is disabled by default.
- If the URL box is empty, valid Input File(s) can silently populate it.
- If URL Box Persistence is enabled, saved URL box text loads first on startup.

### Job Queue Tab

Use this tab when captures should be staged, split, resumed, or run in batches.

Typical flow:

1. Add work from the Capture tab or URL Preview tab.
2. Check the jobs to run.
3. Start checked jobs or run the full queue.
4. Review status, failures, interruptions, and completed work.

Queued jobs keep their own capture settings. App-level settings such as Proxy Options and Universal Download Archive are evaluated when the job runs.

### URL Preview Tab

Use this tab to inspect URLs before capture. It supports regular URLs and playlist, channel, or context-style URLs.

Typical flow:

1. Let the tab load URLs from the current URL box or selected Input File(s).
2. Use the **Preview** checkmarks to choose which URLs should be queried by **Preview Checked**.
3. Use the **Include** checkmarks to choose which rows should be used by **Start Included** or **Queue Included**.
4. Use **Preview All**, **Start All**, or **Queue All** when every top-level URL row should be acted on regardless of checkmarks.
5. Select a previewed regular URL to review its thumbnail and metadata.
6. Select a playlist/context URL to review its thumbnail/metadata and its available item rows. Once playlist/context data is confirmed, top-level Start/Queue actions use those item URLs instead of only the source playlist URL.
7. Right-click a highlighted URL row to preview, start, queue, open, copy, or export only that highlighted row.
8. Start, queue, export, copy, or apply playlist-item filters as needed.

Previewing makes source requests through `yt-dlp` but does not download media. Thumbnail modes may create cached thumbnail files.

### Case Browser Tab

Use this tab to review local case output.

Typical flow:

1. Select a case folder or subfolder.
2. Filter or sort files as needed.
3. Open files or related artifacts from file cards.
4. Verify case files against the latest SHA256 manifest when needed.

File-card columns automatically reflow based on the available pane width and selected icon scale.

## Advanced Usage

### Capture Tab: Case Names and URL Sources

Case names can use tags from the **Insert Tag** menu. Tags resolve when a capture starts or when a job is queued.

Useful tags include:

- date/time tags
- URL-domain tags
- preset-related tags
- `%playlist%` for URL Preview playlist/context captures and queue jobs

The `%playlist%` tag resolves from the URL Preview playlist/context title when playlist or context metadata is available. When URL Preview starts or queues a playlist/context source, the app automatically appends `%playlist%` to the case-name template for that run or queued job if the template does not already include it.

The default case name is `Case-%datetime%`.

The URL box supports pasted URLs and one or more Input File(s). Multiple Input File(s) are stored as a semicolon-separated list.

URL box helpers can normalize, validate, deduplicate, group, summarize, copy, save, or clear URL text. Failed and captured URL tools use app-level URL history files under the Output Root.

### Capture Tab: Capture, Metadata, Pacing, and Advanced Options

Capture options are split into four panels:

- **Capture Options**: capture mode, source scope, playlist behavior, format, archive behavior, date filters, and Output Records
- **Metadata Options**: sidecar artifacts and embedded metadata
- **Pacing Options**: request delay, retries, throttling behavior, HTTP chunk size, speed limits, and fragment concurrency
- **Advanced Options**: browser impersonation, failure behavior, concurrent queue captures, keyword filters, and partial-file handling

Capture modes:

- **Media + sidecars**: media plus selected sidecar files
- **Media + embedded metadata**: media plus selected embedded metadata, without sidecar artifact files
- **Media only**: media without sidecars or embeds
- **Metadata/artifacts only**: supported artifacts without media download

Output Records controls Case Browser cache timing and file manifest scope.

Archive behavior:

- **Use case download archive** uses the resolved case folder's `download-archive.txt` by default and passes archive tracking to yt-dlp.
- **Ignore archive for this run** does not use download archive history but still avoids overwriting exact existing files.
- **Force re-capture** requests overwrite/re-capture behavior.
- **Universal Download Archive** is an optional app-level Settings menu feature. It applies only when Archive Mode is **Use**.
- When Universal Download Archive is enabled, yt-dlp uses `universal-download-archive.txt` for skip/write behavior while the current case archive is still maintained.
- Items skipped because they already exist in the universal archive are logged during capture and summarized under the case `manifests` folder as JSON/CSV. Direct capture and queue summaries also show those skips when applicable.
- **Stop when archived item is found** uses the active archive. With Universal Download Archive enabled, it can stop on entries captured in earlier cases.

### Capture Tab: Domain Presets and Proxy Options

Domain Presets save capture-option combinations for one or more domains. Matching active presets can apply automatically, with higher-priority presets overriding lower-priority matches.

Proxy Options are app-level. Supported protocol choices are **None**, `http`, `https`, `socks4`, and `socks5`.

Proxy settings can include credentials. If saved, they are stored unencrypted in `gui-settings.json`. Enable the session-only option when proxy details should not be saved.

### Job Queue Tab: Queue Management

The queue supports:

- checked-job starts
- full-queue starts
- split-and-queue workflows
- interruption recovery
- clearing completed, failed, interrupted, or selected jobs
- persisted queue state in `gui-jobs.json`
- schema warnings for older queued jobs

Concurrent queue capture is available, with domain-collision checks to reduce accidental simultaneous captures against the same domain.

URL Preview queue actions pass playlist/context titles into queued jobs when metadata is available. Top-level URL Preview queue actions create one queued job per top-level row being queued. If that row has confirmed playlist/context metadata with extracted item URLs, the queued job contains those playlist/context item URLs under the playlist-tagged case name instead of only the source playlist URL. **Queue All** queues all usable top-level rows. **Queue Included** queues rows with Include checked. Playlist/context item queue actions remain grouped into one queued job for the selected playlist/context and use a single `%playlist%` value.

### URL Preview Tab: Metadata, Thumbnails, and Queueing

The tab silently parses current URL sources so the top URL list is ready when selected. The URL box takes priority; if it is empty, selected Input File(s) are used.

URL Preview uses a top-level URL list and a context-sensitive lower panel. The top list has separate checkmarks:

- **Preview** controls which rows are queried by **Preview Checked**.
- **Include** controls which rows are used by **Start Included** and **Queue Included**.
- **All** actions act on all usable top-level rows regardless of checkmark state.

Top-level actions include **Preview All**, **Preview Checked**, **Start All**, **Start Included**, **Queue All**, **Queue Included**, **Stop**, and **Export JSON**. Right-click a highlighted row to preview, start, queue, open, copy, or export only that row.

When a previewed playlist/channel/context row has extracted item URLs, Start and Queue actions use those item URLs instead of only the source playlist URL. Top-level queue actions create one job per top-level row. Playlist/context item actions group included item URLs into one playlist-tagged job.

The lower **Selected URL Context** area changes based on selection:

- regular URLs show **Thumbnail** and **Metadata** tabs
- playlist/channel/context rows show those tabs plus a playlist/context item list
- selecting a playlist/context item updates the Thumbnail and Metadata tabs for that item

Playlist/context item actions include **Start All Items**, **Start Included Items**, **Queue All Items**, **Queue Included Items**, **Copy Included URLs**, **Load Included URLs**, **Append Included URLs**, **Set Playlist Items**, **Include All**, and **Exclude All**. Included item actions use the item **Include** checkmarks; right-click a highlighted item for single-item actions.

**Load Included URLs** replaces the URL box with individual included playlist/context item URLs. **Append Included URLs** appends them to the existing URL box. **Set Playlist Items** keeps the original playlist workflow and writes included item indexes into Capture tab playlist item filtering.

The collapsible **Preview Options** panel opens from the bottom-left of the URL Preview tab. It includes preview pacing, thumbnail mode, thumbnail rate limiting, cache mode, playlist mode, max items, and timeout seconds.

Preview pacing adds delay and jitter between preview metadata requests. The app warns before querying more than 10 preview URLs and stops when output suggests rate limiting, bot challenges, or temporary blocking.

Thumbnail fetching is best-effort and may fail even when the media URL is valid. **Rate limit thumbnails** uses post-fetch cooldowns and shows a counter in the Thumbnail tab when active. Changing selection updates the active thumbnail target without queueing multiple thumbnail requests.

URL Preview cache has two modes:

- **Temporary**: stores preview cache under the resolved case folder. If the final case folder is not known yet, temporary files are staged under `<OutputRoot>\.gui-cache` and cleared after they are copied into the resolved case cache.
- **Reuse cached thumbnails**: stores reusable thumbnail cache under `<OutputRoot>\.gui-cache\url-preview-persistent`. This cache is outside case files and is cleared by `--fresh`.

URL Preview metadata depends on yt-dlp extractor behavior. Fast playlist scans may provide limited per-item metadata, while deep metadata mode can be slower and make more source requests.

### Case Browser Tab: Review and Verification

The Case Browser loads the selected Output Root in the background. Case-level `.gui-cache` folders are rebuildable GUI cache, not case evidence; they are hidden from Case Browser listings and excluded from verification/manifests. Folders that only contain GUI cache, such as preview-only folders with `manifests\.gui-cache`, are not shown as cases. Output Root `.gui-cache` is temporary and cleared by `--fresh`.

It supports:

- folder tree navigation
- current-folder-only view
- file-type filters
- sorting by name, domain, type, size, newest, or oldest
- dynamic file-card columns
- icon scale options
- right-click file actions
- FFmpeg thumbnails in `.gui-cache\thumbnails`
- FFprobe media details in `.gui-cache\metadata`
- SHA256 manifest verification

Verification applies to a selected case folder or subfolder. The Output Root itself cannot be verified. `.gui-cache` and `manifests` are excluded from verification scope.

### App Update Checks

The app update checker opens the latest app release page for manual download. It does not download, extract, replace, or run app files.

yt-dlp updates are separate from normal capture runs and use the selected local `yt-dlp.exe`.

Deno updates can be started from **Tools > Update Deno**, which runs `deno upgrade` against the detected local Deno executable. The app warns first because newer Deno builds may be incompatible or blocked by endpoint controls. Deno should still be staged beside `yt-dlp.exe` for this portable workflow; script-level PATH fallback is best-effort only.

## Profiles and Settings

The app stores settings, profiles, domain presets, and app-level settings in `gui-settings.json` beside the app.

The **Default** profile is loaded on startup. Custom profiles can be created, loaded, saved, and deleted from the Profile menu.

Profile-level settings include capture paths, capture options, metadata options, pacing options, advanced options, URL/input settings, selected VPN adapter, and URL Preview settings.

Profile-level URL Preview settings include:

- preview pacing
- thumbnail mode
- thumbnail rate limiting
- URL Preview cache mode
- playlist mode
- max playlist items
- preview timeout

App-level settings include Delete Cookies on Exit, Check VPN, Dark Mode, Job Persistence, URL Box Persistence, Universal Download Archive, Case Browser preferences, and Proxy Options. Universal Download Archive applies only when Archive Mode is **Use**.

Other app-root state files:

- `gui-jobs.json` for persisted queue jobs
- `gui-url-box.txt` for URL Box Persistence, when enabled
- `universal-download-archive.txt` for the app-level universal download archive, when enabled and used

`python gui.py --fresh` deletes `gui-settings.json`, `gui-jobs.json`, `gui-url-box.txt`, `universal-download-archive.txt`, app-level captured/failed URL history files, and the temporary Output Root `.gui-cache` folder. It does not delete case folders, case-level `.gui-cache` folders, media files, cookies, binaries, or scripts.

## Cookies Handling

Cookies File use is disabled by default.

Cookie-related notes:

- cookies are not required for every capture or preview
- cookies are sensitive operational data
- URL Preview metadata requests can use the selected Cookies File when Cookies File use is enabled
- Reliable thumbnail fallback through yt-dlp can also benefit from the same cookie/session context
- cookie use does not guarantee access to private, authenticated, restricted, or challenge-protected content
- exported cookies can optionally be applied to the main Cookies File field
- local cookie encrypt/decrypt helpers are available
- Delete Cookies on Exit can remove the selected cookies file when the app closes

The app does not automate website logins or collect credentials.

## Limitations

- Site support depends on the installed `yt-dlp` build and the source platform.
- URL Preview depends on the installed `yt-dlp` build and source extractor behavior. Fast scans may return limited metadata, while deep scans and reliable thumbnail mode can be slower and make more source requests.
- Thumbnail fetching is best-effort and may fail even when the media URL is valid.
- Large playlists and very large cases can take time to preview, render, cache, export, capture, scan, or verify.
- Universal Download Archive skip behavior applies only when the setting is enabled and Archive Mode is **Use**. It is an app-level history file, not a case evidence artifact. When enabled, archive-based skipping and Stop when archived item is found can reflect captures from other cases. Universal archive skips are logged and summarized, but the app does not yet maintain a universal capture index or copy prior case media into new cases.
- Browser impersonation targets depend on the installed `yt-dlp` build.
- Proxy and VPN behavior depends on local policy and routing.
- Case Browser thumbnails and media details require FFmpeg/FFprobe.
- Manifest verification checks file hashes only; it does not assess content authenticity or legal sufficiency.
- The app is not a replacement for authorization, evidence-handling policy, or analyst judgment.

## Changelog

### v0.2026.0621 - URL Preview, Universal Archive, and Cache Handling

- Replaced **Playlist Preview** with a broader **URL Preview** workflow for metadata preview, thumbnail preview, playlist/context item review, JSON export, and preview-derived start/queue actions.

#### Settings and Profiles

- Added app-level `Delete Cookies on Exit` setting under the Settings menu.

- Made Start Capture skip the VPN warning when `Check VPN` is disabled.
- Disabled VPN-related Tools menu actions when `Check VPN` is disabled.

- Added OS labels beside discovered impersonate targets when available.
- Filtered yt-dlp log/status lines such as `[info]` from the target list.
