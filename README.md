## Overview

`Webpage/Audio/Video/Image Capture GUI for OSINT` (`WAVI Capture GUI for OSINT`) is a local, portable interface for repeatable capture work in managed environments.

The app has six main tabs:

- **Audio/Video Capture** for `yt-dlp` captures.
- **Image Capture** for `gallery-dl` captures.
- **Webpage Capture** for extension-free full-page or visible-viewport PNG captures, with optional PDF output, using Deno and an isolated Edge/Chrome profile.
- **Job Queue** for staged, concurrent, and recoverable jobs.
- **Audio/Video Preview** for metadata, thumbnails, playlist/context review, and queueing from preview results.
- **Case Browser** for local review, thumbnails, metadata, and hash verification.

The app does not bundle capture tools or make authorization decisions. Tools, credentials, network paths, cookies, proxy/VPN use, and capture scope should be approved separately through normal organizational processes.

## Intended Users

This app is intended for investigators, analysts, and support staff who need a consistent way to collect approved audio/video, image, gallery, rendered webpage, or metadata output without manually rebuilding command-line arguments for every case.

It is designed for local Windows use. Keep the app folder and case output on local storage during active captures, then move or archive cases through approved evidence-handling processes.

## What the App Does

The app helps users:

- prepare URL lists or input files
- run preflight checks for required local tools
- capture audio/video with `yt-dlp`
- capture image/gallery content with `gallery-dl`
- capture full-page or visible-viewport webpage PNGs through an isolated installed Edge/Chrome browser
- record webpage capture metadata, redirects, dimensions, warnings, hashes, and segmented fallbacks for oversized pages
- organize output into case folders
- apply case names, filename templates, cookies, proxy settings, pacing, archive, and metadata options
- queue multiple jobs and recover interrupted work when Job Persistence is enabled
- preview audio/video metadata and thumbnails before capture
- browse local case files and verify SHA256 manifests

## What the App Does Not Do

The app does not:

- include or auto-install `yt-dlp`, `gallery-dl`, FFmpeg/FFprobe, Deno, Edge/Chrome, Python, or PowerShell
- bypass endpoint security, firewalls, website controls, access restrictions, login requirements, bot challenges, or rate limits
- decide whether a capture is legal, approved, proportionate, or in scope
- collect passwords, automate sign-ins, use the normal browser profile, extract browser cookies, or solve interactive challenges
- guarantee that any source platform is supported
- analyze evidence, identify people, assess authenticity, or determine evidentiary value
- upload, sync, or retain cases outside the selected local output paths

## Required Components

Place the GUI, scripts, and approved tools in a local portable folder unless your organization uses a different staged path.

Required files/tools:

- `gui.py`
- `script-ytdlp.ps1`
- `script-gallerydl.ps1`
- `script-webcapture.ps1`
- `script-webcapture.ts`
- `yt-dlp.exe`
- `gallery-dl.exe`
- `ffmpeg.exe`
- `ffprobe.exe`
- `deno.exe`
- Python 3
- Windows PowerShell
- Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome installed locally for Webpage Capture

`deno.exe` should be beside `yt-dlp.exe`. `gallery-dl.exe` can be beside the app or selected manually in the Image Capture tab. Webpage Capture uses the installed Edge or Chrome executable selected in its tab; the browser itself is not bundled. The app creates temporary handoff files and isolated browser profiles under its own `gui-temp` folder and removes them after use.

Recommended source pages:

- WAVI Capture GUI releases: <https://github.com/jmashuque/avi-capture-gui-for-osint/releases/latest>
- Python: <https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PNRBTZXMB4Z>
- yt-dlp releases: <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases>
- yt-dlp nightly builds: <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds/releases>
- gallery-dl releases: <https://codeberg.org/mikf/gallery-dl/releases>
- Deno releases: <https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases>
- FFmpeg Windows builds by Gyan.dev: <https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/>

Use approved releases for your environment. For FFmpeg, the Gyan.dev release essentials build is usually enough because it includes both `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe`.

## Basic Usage

This section is for normal users who only need to stage the app and run approved captures. Most users should not need to change Advanced Options.

### Setup and Staging

Do this once before the first capture, or whenever you are preparing a fresh copy of the app. Use organization-approved download locations or staged files when your environment provides them.

1. Create a local folder for the app, such as:

   ```text
   C:\AVI-Capture-GUI
   ```

2. Download the latest WAVI Capture GUI release ZIP from:

   ```text
   https://github.com/jmashuque/avi-capture-gui-for-osint/releases/latest
   ```

3. Right-click the downloaded ZIP, choose **Properties**, select **Unblock** if that option appears, then choose **Extract All**. Do not run the app from inside the ZIP.

4. Move or extract the app files into the local app folder. The folder should contain at least:

   ```text
   gui.py
   script-ytdlp.ps1
   script-gallerydl.ps1
   script-webcapture.ps1
   script-webcapture.ts
   README.md
   LICENSE
   ```

5. Install Python 3 if it is not already installed. The easiest user-facing option is the Microsoft Store Python 3 package. If your organization uses Software Center, Company Portal, Intune, winget, or another approved source, use that instead.

6. Download the required capture tools and place the executable files in the same app folder unless your team gives you a different staged folder:

   | Tool | What to place in the app folder | Source page |
   |---|---|---|
   | yt-dlp | `yt-dlp.exe` | <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases> |
   | gallery-dl | `gallery-dl.exe` | <https://codeberg.org/mikf/gallery-dl/releases> |
   | Deno | `deno.exe` | <https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases> |
   | FFmpeg | `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe` | <https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/> |

   For FFmpeg, download a Windows release build, open the ZIP, then copy `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe` from the `bin` folder into the app folder.

7. Confirm the app folder now looks similar to this:

   ```text
   C:\AVI-Capture-GUI\
     gui.py
     script-ytdlp.ps1
     script-gallerydl.ps1
     script-webcapture.ps1
     script-webcapture.ts
     yt-dlp.exe
     gallery-dl.exe
     deno.exe
     ffmpeg.exe
     ffprobe.exe
   ```

Keep this folder together. `deno.exe` should be beside `yt-dlp.exe`. Keep the app on a local drive during active captures instead of running it from inside the ZIP, email attachment, browser download preview, or network share.

### Start a Capture

1. Open the app folder in File Explorer.

2. Start the GUI. Use one of these methods:

   - If `.py` files already open with Python, double-click `gui.py`.
   - If double-clicking does not work, click the File Explorer address bar, type `powershell`, and press **Enter**. In the PowerShell window that opens, run:

     ```powershell
     py .\gui.py
     ```

   - If Windows says `py` is not recognized, try:

     ```powershell
     python .\gui.py
     ```

   - If both commands fail, Python is not installed or is not available to the user session. Install Python through an approved source or ask IT to stage it.

3. Choose the correct tab:

   - **Audio/Video Capture** for video, audio, and supported media posts handled by `yt-dlp`.
   - **Image Capture** for image links, galleries, albums, and supported photo-post sources handled by `gallery-dl`.
   - **Webpage Capture** for public HTTP/HTTPS webpages rendered by an isolated installed Edge or Chrome browser.

4. Confirm the tool paths shown on the tab. If a path is blank or points to the wrong folder, use the browse button beside that field.

5. Enter or keep the case name. The app resolves the final case folder before capture.

6. Paste approved URLs into the URL box, or select an input file containing one URL per line.

7. Run **Preflight Check**. Fix any missing tool or folder warning before starting the capture.

8. Click **Start Capture**.

9. Leave the app open until the capture finishes, then review the output log and case folder.

The URL box takes priority over input files. Clear the URL box if you want the selected input file to be used instead.

### Capture a Webpage

Use **Webpage Capture** for a rendered webpage screenshot and optional PDF without a browser extension.

1. Open **Webpage Capture**.
2. Confirm the **Script Path**, **Deno Path**, and **Browser Path** fields. Use **Auto-detect** for Edge or Chrome when needed.
3. Enter a case name and filename template. Both fields include an **Insert Tag** menu, and the tab shows resolved case/output examples below the fields.
4. Open **Capture Options** to choose full-page or visible-viewport PNG mode, viewport dimensions, page-load timing, lazy-load scrolling, and Webpage Capture concurrency. Close the panel to return to the main workflow.
5. Open **PDF Options** when you also want PDF output. Enable **Create PDF with PNG**, choose a **PDF Source**, then adjust landscape/portrait, paper size, scale, margins, and optional headers/footers. **Live Page (searchable)** uses Chromium's normal `Page.printToPDF` output and exposes page ranges, CSS page-size preference, backgrounds, and **Live Page Layout** choices (**Keep site print layout**, **Remove fixed/sticky positioning**, or **Hide likely top navigation**). **Captured PNG (visual match)** builds an image-only PDF from the saved PNG capture so sticky headers or print CSS no longer repeat over content. By default, the header shows the final URL and UTC capture timestamp.
6. Enter the Output Root and one or more public `http://` or `https://` URLs.
7. Run **Preflight Check**. This creates a new temporary browser profile, launches the browser in headless mode, and tests the loopback DevTools connection.
8. Click **Start Capture**.
9. Review the PNG, optional PDF, `.webcapture.json` sidecar, run log, and SHA256 manifest in the case folder.

Each run uses a unique browser profile under `gui-temp`. Webpage Capture does not open or read the user's normal Edge/Chrome profile, browser cookie database, saved passwords, or existing signed-in session. This first version is intended for public pages and does not automate login, consent banners, CAPTCHAs, or other page interactions.

Very tall pages may be written as numbered PNG segments instead of one oversized PNG. The JSON sidecar records the segment positions and hashes.

### Use the Job Queue

Use **Job Queue** when you want to prepare several captures before running them.

1. Add work from **Audio/Video Capture**, **Image Capture**, **Webpage Capture**, or **Audio/Video Preview**.
2. Review the queued jobs.
3. Start the full queue, checked jobs, or highlighted jobs from the right-click menu.
4. Leave the app open while the queue runs.
5. Review failed or interrupted jobs after the run.

The Job Queue is also where interrupted work is resumed when **Job Persistence** is enabled.

### Resume Interrupted Captures

If the app closes, crashes, or a capture is stopped while **Job Persistence** is enabled, reopen the app and go to **Job Queue**. The interrupted capture should appear with an **Interrupted** status.

To resume it:

1. Open **Job Queue**.
2. Select the interrupted job.
3. Use **Continue Checked Interrupted** or right-click the highlighted job and choose **Continue Highlighted Interrupted**.
4. Leave the app open while the resumed queue job runs.

Direct captures are also saved as running recovery jobs only when **Job Persistence** is enabled. If Job Persistence is disabled, direct captures are not saved to the queue and cannot be resumed from the app after a close or crash.

Audio/Video and Webpage Capture jobs continue from the first URL that was not fully marked complete. Image jobs resubmit the original URLs and rely on gallery-dl archive skipping to avoid repeating completed items.

### Preview Audio/Video Links

Use **Audio/Video Preview** when you want to inspect media metadata or playlist/context entries before capture.

1. Add URLs to the preview list.
2. Run Preview for all, selected, or visible rows.
3. Review metadata, thumbnails, and playlist/context items.
4. Start or queue the previewed rows you want to capture.

Preview is best-effort. It can be slower or incomplete depending on the site, cookies, network path, and installed `yt-dlp` build.

### Review a Case

Use **Case Browser** to review local case output.

- Select an Output Root.
- Filter or sort case files.
- Open case folders or individual files.
- Generate or verify SHA256 manifests.

Case Browser is for local review only. It does not determine evidentiary value.

## Advanced Usage

This section is for users who understand the tools, site behavior, rate limits, and organizational handling requirements.

### Portable Layout

Keep these files together unless paths are intentionally changed in the GUI:

```text
gui.py
script-ytdlp.ps1
script-gallerydl.ps1
script-webcapture.ts
yt-dlp.exe
gallery-dl.exe
deno.exe
ffmpeg.exe
ffprobe.exe
```

Recommended layout:

- keep the app folder local
- keep active Output Roots local and non-synced
- avoid running active captures from network shares
- treat cookies, URL lists, logs, archives, preview exports, and case metadata as sensitive operational data

### Audio/Video Capture

Audio/Video Capture uses `script-ytdlp.ps1` and `yt-dlp.exe`.

Useful advanced controls include:

- case-name and filename-template tags
- playlist/source-scope controls
- capture mode and format strategy
- sidecar and embedded metadata options
- rate limit, retry, throttling, HTTP chunk size, and concurrent fragments
- keyword filters and failure handling
- yt-dlp update checks and stable/nightly update targets

### Image Capture

Image Capture uses `script-gallerydl.ps1` and `gallery-dl.exe`.

Useful advanced controls include:

- image-specific case name and filename template
- media versus metadata-only mode
- case archive, ignore archive, or force re-capture modes
- max item and item-range limits
- metadata, info JSON, and tags sidecars
- pacing, retries, timeout, and Image Capture concurrent captures
- gallery-dl update checks and stable/dev update targets

The image filename template is relative to the case `media` folder. Case/context tags resolve when the job is created. gallery-dl item tags resolve per downloaded item.

### Webpage Capture

Webpage Capture uses `script-webcapture.ps1`, `script-webcapture.ts`, `deno.exe`, and an installed Chromium-based Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome browser. It communicates with the newly launched browser over the loopback Chrome DevTools Protocol connection and does not require a browser extension, Selenium, WebDriver, Playwright, Puppeteer, or downloaded packages.

The tab follows the same compact options workflow as the other capture tabs:

- **Capture Options** opens a collapsible overlay for PNG mode, viewport size, load timing, lazy-load scrolling, and concurrency.
- **PDF Options** opens a compact tabbed overlay with **Source & Output**, **Page Layout**, and **Header & Footer** sections. The Close button remains in a fixed footer so it stays visible on shorter displays. The overlay supports two PDF sources: **Live Page (searchable)** for Chromium `Page.printToPDF` output and **Captured PNG (visual match)** for image-based PDF output built from the captured PNG. Live Page also includes layout choices for handling repeated fixed or sticky webpage overlays.
- Opening either options panel closes the other; the arrow indicator changes while a panel is open, and closing a panel saves the current settings.
- A semicolon-delimited summary appears beside the two buttons and includes the active capture, scrolling, concurrency, and PDF settings.
- **Case Name** and **Filename Template** provide **Insert Tag** menus. The filename preview reflects full-page versus viewport naming and shows the optional PDF filename when PDF output is enabled.

The first-version security boundary is intentionally narrow:

- public `http://` and `https://` pages only
- a unique app-owned `--user-data-dir` beneath `gui-temp` for every run
- no access to normal Edge/Chrome profiles or AppData browser databases
- no cookie extraction, DPAPI decryption, password access, or automatic sign-in
- remote debugging bound only to `127.0.0.1`/localhost
- no `--no-sandbox`, certificate-error bypass, security disabling, or LAN-exposed debugging port
- Deno receives only the subprocess, loopback-network, and selected app/case path permissions needed for the run

Full-page mode waits for the page load event, allows an additional settling delay, optionally scrolls in bounded steps to trigger lazy content, measures the page, and uses the browser's DevTools screenshot function. Visible-viewport mode captures only the configured viewport. Optional PDF output now has two modes. **Live Page (searchable)** uses Chromium's `Page.printToPDF` capability and exposes its main print options, including custom header and footer templates, page ranges, print backgrounds, and Live Page Layout controls for keeping the site print layout, removing fixed/sticky positioning, or hiding likely top navigation. **Captured PNG (visual match)** takes the saved PNG capture (including segmented full-page captures when needed) and lays it out across PDF pages, producing an image-based PDF that avoids repeated sticky or fixed overlays. For this mode, Deno temporarily serves the generated image-only document and PNG slices from a randomized endpoint bound only to `127.0.0.1`; the endpoint is shut down immediately after PDF creation and does not upload the images externally. If a page exceeds the configured safe single-image dimensions or pixel count, the helper captures numbered vertical PNG segments, records them in the sidecar, and can use those same segments as the source for Captured PNG PDF output.

Typical output is:

```text
<case>\
  media\
    web\
      <name>.png
      <name>_print.pdf
      <name>.webcapture.json
  logs\
    web-capture_<timestamp>.log
  manifests\
    sha256-manifest-web_<timestamp>.csv
```

The JSON sidecar records the requested and final URLs, redirect chain, main-document status and headers, page title, browser/version, viewport and content dimensions, timing, scrolling result, PDF settings, the selected PDF capture mode, any live-webpage behavior results, paginated-PNG PDF layout details when used, console/page warnings, output files, and SHA256 hashes. When PDF output is requested but the browser cannot create it, the URL is left incomplete for queue/recovery purposes rather than being marked fully successful. The screenshot is a rendered visual capture of what the selected browser presented at the recorded time; it is not a server-side archive or an authenticity determination.

Browser automation can still be blocked by enterprise Edge/Chrome policy, Defender for Endpoint, WDAC/AppLocker, ASR, or Controlled Folder Access. The tab's preflight is designed to test the isolated-profile and loopback-debugging workflow before a capture starts.

### Job Queue, Persistence, and Recovery

The Job Queue runs staged work, manages concurrent captures, and resumes interrupted jobs. It supports `yt-dlp`, `gallery-dl`, and Webpage Capture jobs.

**Job Persistence** controls whether queue state is saved to `gui-jobs.json`. When it is enabled, queued jobs and direct captures are saved while they run. If a running job is still present when the app reopens, it is treated as interrupted and can be continued from the Job Queue. When Job Persistence is disabled, direct captures are not recoverable through the app after a close or crash.

Recovery behavior is engine-specific:

- **Audio/Video Capture (`yt-dlp`)** records completed URL markers. Continuing an interrupted job submits the first incomplete URL and anything after it.
- **Image Capture (`gallery-dl`)** uses archive-backed retry. Continuing an interrupted image job resubmits the original URLs and lets the case archive, or the image universal archive when enabled, skip completed items.
- **Webpage Capture** records completed URL markers. Continuing an interrupted job starts with the first webpage URL not marked complete.

Concurrent queue behavior:

- Audio/Video, Image Capture, and Webpage Capture have separate concurrent-capture limits.
- `yt-dlp`, `gallery-dl`, and Webpage Capture jobs may run at the same time when their domains do not collide.
- Same-domain concurrent jobs trigger a collision prompt so users can continue, wait, or cancel.

Each recoverable job can write `manifests/gui-job-recovery-<job-id>.json` under the case folder. These files explain what the app tried to resume; they are not a replacement for the normal case manifest or review notes.

### Domain Presets, Proxy, VPN, and Archives

- **Domain Presets** can apply capture settings automatically to matching Audio/Video or Image Capture URLs.
- **Proxy Options** are app-level and can be passed to the capture scripts and Webpage Capture. The first Webpage Capture version supports only proxies that do not require credentials.
- **Check VPN** is disabled by default and warns before capture when enabled and the selected adapter does not look connected.
- **Universal Download Archive** uses separate app-level archive files:
  - `universal-download-archive.txt` for Audio/Video Capture
  - `universal-gallerydl-archive.sqlite3` for Image Capture

Universal archives are useful for avoiding repeat captures across cases, but they are not evidence artifacts for a specific case.

### Update Checks

The app has user-triggered update helpers for staged local tools:

- **Check/Update yt-dlp** on the Audio/Video Capture tab
- **Check/Update gallery-dl** on the Image Capture tab
- **Tools > Update Deno** for the detected local `deno.exe`

The app does not auto-update tools on launch. Updates should be used only when approved for the environment.

## Profiles and Settings

The app stores settings beside the app in `gui-settings.json`. **Job Persistence** should stay enabled if users need queue recovery or direct-capture recovery after a close or crash.

Common state files:

- `gui-settings.json` for settings, profiles, app settings, and domain presets
- `gui-jobs.json` for persisted queue jobs when Job Persistence is enabled
- `gui-url-box.txt`, `gui-image-url-box.txt`, and `gui-web-url-box.txt` when URL Box Persistence is enabled
- `universal-download-archive.txt` and `universal-gallerydl-archive.sqlite3` when universal archives are enabled
- case-level `manifests/gui-job-recovery-<job-id>.json` files for recovery details

The **Default** profile loads on startup. Custom profiles can be managed from the Profile menu.

`python gui.py --fresh` clears app settings/state files, Job Queue persistence, URL-box persistence, app-owned temp files, the app debug log, universal archives, GUI cache folders under known Output Roots, and narrow app-owned atomic write temp files. It also reads saved Job Queue state before deleting it so older job-only Output Roots can be cleaned. It does not delete captured case folders, media files, cookies, binaries, scripts, case logs, manifests, or case-specific capture archives.

## Cookies Handling

Cookies File use is disabled by default.

Cookies can help with approved authenticated captures or previews, but they are sensitive operational data. Cookie use does not guarantee access to restricted, private, expired, challenge-protected, or unsupported content.

The app can:

- use a selected cookies file for Audio/Video Capture, Image Capture, and Audio/Video Preview when enabled
- export browser cookies through yt-dlp's supported cookie export flow
- optionally encrypt or decrypt local cookies files
- delete selected Audio/Video and/or Image Capture cookies files on exit when configured

The app does not collect credentials or automate website logins.

## Limitations

- Source support depends on the installed `yt-dlp` and `gallery-dl` versions, the installed Edge/Chrome version, browser policy, and the source platform.
- Preview metadata and thumbnails are best-effort and may be incomplete, stale, unavailable, or slow.
- Large playlists, large galleries, very tall/dynamic webpages, and large cases may take time to capture, scan, cache, export, or verify.
- Universal archive skips can reflect captures from other cases by design.
- Browser impersonation depends on the installed `yt-dlp` build and may be blocked by endpoint policy.
- Webpage Capture may be blocked when browser remote debugging, developer tools, Deno child-process launches, loopback automation, or writes to the selected Output Root are restricted by enterprise policy.
- Infinite feeds, virtualized lists, canvas/WebGL content, animations, autoplaying video, bot challenges, login/MFA flows, and pages that detect headless automation may be incomplete or unavailable.
- Webpage Capture does not automatically dismiss banners, expand controls, accept consent, or interact with page content.
- Proxy/VPN behavior depends on local routing, policy, and source-platform handling.
- Case Browser thumbnails and media details generally require FFmpeg/FFprobe.
- Manifest verification checks file hashes only; it does not assess authenticity, context, or legal sufficiency.
- The app is not a substitute for authorization, evidence-handling policy, or analyst judgment.

### v0.2026.0621 - URL Preview, Universal Archive, and Cache Handling

- Replaced **Playlist Preview** with a broader **URL Preview** workflow for metadata preview, thumbnail preview, playlist/context item review, JSON export, and preview-derived start/queue actions.
- Added profile-level URL Preview options for preview pacing, thumbnail mode, thumbnail rate limiting, cache mode, playlist mode, max items, and preview timeout.
- Added playlist-aware URL Preview start/queue behavior, including expansion of confirmed playlist/context rows to extracted item URLs and `%playlist%` case-name support.
- Added optional **Universal Download Archive** skip logging and per-run skip summaries for direct captures and queued jobs.
- Added temporary and reusable URL Preview thumbnail cache modes, with Output Root `.gui-cache` treated as temporary and cleared by `--fresh`.
- Improved cache handling so case-level `.gui-cache` folders are hidden from Case Browser and excluded from verification/manifests.

### v0.2026.0616 - Playlist Preview, URL Persistence, and Case Browser Polish

- Added the **Playlist Preview** tab with manual checked/selected preview scans, request pacing, rate-limit/backoff warnings, playlist/item checkmarks, playlist-split queueing, JSON export, and context menus.
- Added `%playlist%` case-name tag support and automatic playlist-title case naming for Playlist Preview queue jobs.
- Added app-level **URL Box Persistence**, silent Input File auto-population when the URL box is empty, and `--fresh` cleanup for persisted URL-box state.
- Changed default app startup behavior so **Check VPN** and **Use Cookies File** are disabled by default.
- Improved the **Case Browser** with better filename wrapping and dynamic file-card columns that reflow with available pane width.
- Refreshed README usage sections around the four main tabs while keeping prior changelog entries intact.

### v0.2026.0614 - Tabs, Presets, Proxy, and Output Records

- Added a bottom-tab workflow for **Capture**, **Job Queue**, and **Case Browser**, with Case Browser loading the selected Output Root in the background and supporting Domain sort.
- Expanded input and queue workflows with multiple Input Files, queue checkmarks, Start Selected, split-and-add-to-queue, persisted jobs, interrupted job handling, and clearer active preset visibility.
- Reworked Domain Presets so presets use names plus one or more match domains, support priority ordering, import conflict choices, and expose matching preset information in the queue.
- Added app-level Proxy Options with protocol/address/port/credential fields, optional session-only storage, script-side proxy validation, and masked proxy logging.
- Added Output Records controls for Case Browser cache timing and file manifest scope; script success now follows yt-dlp results while cache warnings remain non-fatal.
- Improved responsiveness and cleanup by moving Case Browser scans/cache work off the main UI path, chunking large Case Browser renders, deferring startup work, and removing stale hidden UI/menu code.

### v0.2026.0612 - Queue, URL Workflow, and Advanced Controls

#### URL Box Workflow

- Added one-word URL box buttons for Load, Save, Clear, and Strip.

- Excluded `.gui-cache` and `manifests` from SHA256 manifest generation and verification scope.
- Updated case file verification to ignore `.gui-cache` and `manifests` paths, including older manifests that may reference cache files.
- Changed Verify Case Files so Output Root cannot be verified directly; users must select a case folder or one of its subfolders.

#### App Workflow and Update Checks

- Added Help menu entries for About and Check for Updates.
